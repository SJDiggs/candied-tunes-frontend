# Welcome the the Candied Tunes web app!  

The Candied Tunes app was conceived by Musicians, Fans and Technologists as a way for fans to digitally interact with Musicians while they are performing at a show, by requesting songs, sending tips, signing up for emails and much more.  

There are two persona's, 1: The Audience, and 2: The Musician. 

Audience users can:
- View the Musicians Playlist
- Request songs
- Tip the artist
- View upcoming shows
- Learn more about the band and.or performing artist bio
- Sign up for emails
- ...and much more!  

Musician's can interactively view requested songs, tip amounts, while gigging, and perform a variety of Management features, such as:
- Song Management:
    - View song requests and tip amounts from the Audience
    - Reset the Playlist after the show ends
    - Add new songs to the playlist
    - Remove songs from the playlist
    - Update a songs information such as the main instrument, song name or artist name
- Show Management:
    - Add a show to your list of shows
    - Remove a show 
    - Update a shows information such as the date, location, time and notes
- Admin:

    - Create and send fans an email

There is also an Auth0 login feature which is used to identify Musicians and sign-up Audience users so they can receive emails, etc
